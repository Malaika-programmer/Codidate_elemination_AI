PRACTICAL 2: CANDIDATE ELIMINATION ALGORITHM
============================================================

1. THE ALGORITHM EXPLAINED
The Candidate Elimination Algorithm is a method used to find the "Version Space"[cite: 317]. Unlike Find-S, which only finds the most specific rule, this algorithm maintains two boundaries[cite: 318, 478]:
   - S (Specific Boundary): The most specific rules that cover all positive examples[cite: 335, 442].
   - G (General Boundary): The most general rules that exclude all negative examples[cite: 334, 445].

The "Version Space" consists of all hypotheses that lie between S and G[cite: 320, 393].

2. HOW THE CODE WORKS
The Python script processes the dataset example by example[cite: 448]:

A. IF THE EXAMPLE IS POSITIVE (target == "Yes"):
   - It generalizes the Specific Boundary (S) to ensure the new example is covered[cite: 344, 453].
   - It removes any rules from the General Boundary (G) that are inconsistent with this positive example[cite: 381, 456].

B. IF THE EXAMPLE IS NEGATIVE (target == "No"):
   - It specializes the General Boundary (G)[cite: 352, 459].
   - It creates new versions of G that are specific enough to exclude the negative data but general enough to still cover the rules in S[cite: 354, 466].

3. DATASET: CRICKET SELECTION
The code uses a dataset to predict if a player is "Selected" based on:
   - Batting Style, Bowling Style, Fielding Skill, and Fitness Level[cite: 400, 401].
